Hi John,

I hope you enjoyed the long weekend.  I just wanted to share your August Tear Sheet.  You really gave it a great effort in August and we appreciate it a lot.  We know you traffic in some tough names and wish we could have found you more matches.  You did hit on 5% of your symbols which is in line with what we see in the small cap space.  You are doing your part to be successful:  resting your orders for a long time; being marketable the whole time.  We canâ€™t ask for more than that John.    

August started off really strong here, and though we slowed toward the end, we put up some record numbers.
